# Sign-in Flow

The sign-in flow is the process of authenticating a user and obtaining an access token. The access token is used to access the API.

1. The user navigates to the [Frontend](../project-structure/apps/frontend) application.
2. The application checks if the user is authenticated. If the user is not authenticated a sign-in url is generated by the [OAuth Agent Service](../project-structure/services/oauth-agent-service) and the user is redirected to the sign-in url.
3. The user is redirected to the [Curity Identity Server](../project-structure/services/curity-identity-server) to authenticate.
4. The user is then able to sign-in using their credentials or register a new account.
5. Once the user has authenticated they are redirected back to the [Frontend](../project-structure/apps/frontend) application with an authorization code.
6. The [Frontend](../project-structure/apps/frontend) application exchanges the authorization code for an access token wrapped in a cookie using the [OAuth Agent Service](../project-structure/services/oauth-agent-service).
7. The [Frontend](../project-structure/apps/frontend) application redirects the user to the [Home](../project-structure/apps/frontend) page.
8. The [Frontend](../project-structure/apps/frontend) can now access authenticated APIs using the Token Handler Pattern (described in further detail [here](../architecture/authentication)).
